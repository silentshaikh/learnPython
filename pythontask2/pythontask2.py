# Question 01
# Create a program that takes a year as input and determines if it's a leap year.
# Rules:

# A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.
# ðŸ”¹ Bonus: Extend the program to check if a date (DD-MM-YYYY) is valid.

# take an input to write an leap year
leapYear = int(input('Enter a Year'))

# Question 02
# Create a Simple Calculator where a user enters two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /, %, **, //).

# The program should perform the operation and display the result.
# Handle division by zero error

# Question 03

# Create a number guessing game where:

# The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
# The user has to guess the number.
# The program gives hints like:
# "Too High!" if the guess is greater than the number.
# "Too Low!" if the guess is smaller than the number.
# "Correct! You Win!" if the guess is right.
# ðŸ”¹ Bonus: Limit the number of attempts to 5 and print "Game Over!" if the user fails.

#Chances to play the game
gameCount = 10

# Question 04
# Create a game score system where:

# += 10 for small achievements
# += 20 for medium achievements
# += 50 for big achievements
# The score can be reduced by mistakes:
# -= 5 for small mistakes
# -= 15 for big mistakes
# Bonus: Add a multiplier system where a player can get double points under special conditions.

# Question 05

#Question 08
# Create a traffic light simulation where:
